<h1 align="center">Safedime</h1>
<p align="center">Safedime is a small USB stick, with proof of creation, only the creator can open the private keys, unlike what we have so far, safedime does not have the objective of a person being able to “pass it forward” it has much more the vision of be a physical and cold personal safe, but that only those who created it can open via file-
key the private keys of a bitcoin wallet.</p> 

## There are four states for a Safedime: 


1. New unit (does not have a bitcoin address yet) 
2. Sealed (normal; has a payment address)
3. Unsealed (an encrypted file is generated, but only the key file can open this encryption, then it will reach the next state) 
4. Revealed (private key is revealed; sweep your funds)
